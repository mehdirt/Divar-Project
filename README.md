## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is not available in the repository due to its large size (approximately **1 million records** 📈). It consists of **64 columns**, including:
- 20 numerical columns 🔢
- 44 categorical columns 🏷️

## 🗂️ Project Structure
The `divar_project` repository is divided into 5 main sections:

1. **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) 🔍: Exploratory analysis of data to understand distributions, relationships, and patterns.
2. **Statistical_analysis** 📊: Advanced statistical analyses such as statistical tests and statistical modeling.
3. **recommender_system** 🤖: Implementation of a recommender system for suggesting products or ads.
4. **prediction_price** 💰 and **prediction_rent** 🏠: Predictive models for purchase price and rent. These two sections are in a shared folder.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Data Processing**: pandas 📊, numpy 🔢
- **Visualization**: matplotlib 📈, seaborn 🎨, plotly 📊, geopandas 🗺️
- **Machine Learning**: sklearn 🤖, scipy 🔬
- **Algorithms and Models**: k-means 📍, DBSCAN 🔄, LightGBM 🌟, Random Forest Regressor 🌲

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 🐍
- Install required libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (the requirements.txt file should be available in the repository).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/divar_project.git` 📥
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd divar_project` 📁
3. Create a virtual environment (optional): `python -m venv env` 🏗️
4. Install libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 📦
5. For each section, run the corresponding scripts (e.g., for EDA: `python eda/main.py` ▶️).

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- The original data is not uploaded to the repository due to its size. Please download the data from the relevant source and place it in the `data/` folder. 💾
