# Divar Project

## Project Description
This project analyzes data from the Divar platform, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, recommender system, and price/rent prediction. The main goal is to use machine learning techniques to better understand the data and provide predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is not available in the repository due to its large size (approximately 1 million records). It consists of 64 columns, including:
- 20 numerical columns
- 44 categorical columns

## Project Structure
The `divar_project` repository is divided into 5 main sections:

1. **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis): Exploratory analysis of data to understand distributions, relationships, and patterns.
2. **Statistical_analysis**: Advanced statistical analyses such as statistical tests and statistical modeling.
3. **recommender_system**: Implementation of a recommender system for suggesting products or ads.
4. **prediction_price** and **prediction_rent**: Predictive models for purchase price and rent. These two sections are in a shared folder.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, geopandas
- **Machine Learning**: sklearn, scipy
- **Algorithms and Models**: k-means, DBSCAN, LightGBM, Random Forest Regressor

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Install required libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (the requirements.txt file should be available in the repository).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/divar_project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd divar_project`
3. Create a virtual environment (optional): `python -m venv env`
4. Install libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. For each section, run the corresponding scripts (e.g., for EDA: `python eda/main.py`).

## Important Notes
- The original data is not uploaded to the repository due to its size. Please download the data from the relevant source and place it in the `data/` folder.
- For questions or collaboration, use Issues or Pull Requests.
